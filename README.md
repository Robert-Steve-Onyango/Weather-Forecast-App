# Weather-Forecast-App
Building a weather forecast app will give you valuable experience in working with APIs. You will use Python and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given location and display it to the user. This project will involve making HTTP requests, parsing JSON responses, and presenting the data in a user-friendly way.
